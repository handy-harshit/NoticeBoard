# Description
Hello all, let me introduce you with my webapp called Microsoft Notice Board.
This platform is designed to ease the communication of notices between teachers and students.
As we all know it becomes very difficult for each student to check mails of each teachers regarding the announcement or notices. So this app provides direct transition sliding feed of the notices made by the teachers. Hence, it becomes more easy and exciting for the students to read the respond the announcements.
The techstack we are using are firebase real-time database to store the data and to get authentication web token, Nodejs as a server-side language and Html/css and js for frontend Development.
